# Advent of Code 2020

Python solutions to the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge for [2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

This is my first Advent of Code, and I'm coming to it later than most people, starting on October 14th 2021. I'm doing this as an experiment to see how fast I can go, before deciding whether to attempt 2021's challenge in real time.
